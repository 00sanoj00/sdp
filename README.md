# sdp
An android SDK that provides a new size unit - sdp (scalable dp). This size unit scales with the screen size.

Here is a single layout built using sdp:

And here is the same layout built using dp:

You can see that sdp scales with the screen size and the dp stays with the same size on all screen sizes.
